    <h1>More About Me</h1>

    <p>
        Outside of school and work, I am a very fun person !! I love to play basketball competitively, and I play club basketball at Syracuse University. My love for basketball started when I was in middle school and grew into a grind in high school. I played at Cardinal Hayes Highschool in the Bronx, and I learned how competitive the game could be once you stepped out of your neighborhood. Now, I like to see myself as the best basketball player I have ever been, and every day I am reminded of my love for the grind.

        Aside from basketball, I also like to play chess. I started playing chess when I was in high school and what caught my attention was the complexity of the game. Although chess may seem easy to some, there’s more below the surface that goes on behind the scenes of a chess game that many times observers don’t notice. I like to compare chess to my everyday life because both require patience and problem solving, and I truly believe that playing chess has taught me real life lessons.

        Finally, I am happy to share that I am also a barber and have gotten into cutting hair. I have been practicing and learning gradually since the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am confident enough to expand my clientele. I currently work within the Syracuse community, mainly Syracuse students but I am still open to accept anyone. In trying to expand my clientele, I wanted to be different than other barbers and understand my clients and build trust with them, which lead me to decide that the first haircut for a new client will be free. I decided on this and wanted it to serve as an attempt to remind my client that they have options, and if I am not one of them that’s totally fine.
