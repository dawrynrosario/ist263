    <h1>Stacker + My Projects</h1>
    <p>
        This past summer I had the opportunity to intern at Stacker. Stacker is a journalism company dedicated to offering maximum resources to freelanced editors and authors. They are based on a skilled and creative newsroom that unites thinkers and storytellers from traditional media to highlight and tackle age-old industry difficulties, such as imagining a new way for businesses to ethically contribute to a tradition of trustworthy journalism.
        We publish hundreds and thousands of automated stories regarding gas prices and unemployment rate around America, to even the smallest detailed like pets available for adoption in some random county in Texas. We publish local and national stories, random stories, and significant stories.

    <h2>Where do I come in? </h2>
    <p>
        I get the data for these editors and writers. I deal with thousands of lines of data, where I use different coding languages to simplify all that data, where editors and freelanced writers can make stories with the thousands of lines of data. I work on the local team as a data analyst intern. I work with google and excel sheets, as well as dealing with python, and HTML. I am majoring in Information Management & Technology, so this was a perfect opportunity for me to grow and expand my skillset, as well as network with other professionals in this field. Fortunately, I get to work with the material I am learning at school.
