        <p>
            My name is Dawryn Rosario, and I am a Information Technology and Management major interested in web design and project management. I chose this major because I wanted to learn how to navigate and manage the tool millions of people use per second: the internet. Some recent accomplishments of mine are:
        </p>

        <ul> 
            <li> Went to Portland, Oregon on behalf of the HEOP program at Syracuse University </li>
            <li> Worked as a data analyst intern at a journalism startup named Stacker </li>
            <li> Fluent in <strong> Google sheets and Microsoft Excel </strong> </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
                Outside of work/school, on my free time, I play competitive basketball and I am a barber. My favorite tv show is The Office and fun fact: I have rewatched the show enough to know most of the episodes by heart. I have been learning how to cook and I make a mean chicken alfredo, with plenty of friends as my witness. I enjoy gazing at beautiful views of the world and I try to live by one concept: learn something new everyday.
